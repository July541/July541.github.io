Introduction
============

This is a guide on how to contribute to chapters in Part 1 of the handbook. We
use checklists to check the quality of each section of the handbook. If this is
news to you then please see `the README
<https://github.com/input-output-hk/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/tree/main/Contributing>`_
to get up to speed on the expected project workflow as a writer.
